conversation1='''Patient [Patient Name], a 45-year-old office worker, presented with chronic low back pain radiating down the right leg, aggravated by prolonged sitting and lifting. Examination revealed decreased lumbar spine range of motion, positive straight leg raise test on the right, and weakness in the right gluteal muscles.

Physiotherapy intervention consisted of manual therapy techniques including lumbar spine mobilizations, soft tissue release, and trigger point therapy. Specific strengthening exercises for core muscles and hip flexors were also implemented along with stretches for the hamstrings and lower back.
